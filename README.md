# Hackathon Solidity smart contract

This smart contract can be used to automate jury voting and prize payout process at hackathons.

Administrator (contract owner) can add jury members, sponsors can donate ETH to the prize pool and contestents can register teams and receive prizes from the pool.

This is just a basic version for now, we are looking to expand it soon (e.g. making the prize structure more flexible, adding front-end etc.)

## Development
to install all modules run ```yarn```

to start dev server on localhost:8080 run ```yarn dev```

to build production run ```yarn production```. Production code will be generated in the dist directory
